First of all, I want to thank my advisor Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang, for guiding me through the journey in pursuit of a Ph.D. degree.
Roland's passion for research has pushed me to the best that I can achieve.
He dedicated much of his time to our collaboration, and many good ideas followed from our discussions.
I also want to thank my oral-defense committee members,
Prof. Dirk Beyer, Prof. Ichiro Hasuo, Dr. Victor N. Kravets, and Dr. Bow-Yaw Wang,
for reviewing this dissertation and giving me much feedback during the oral defense.

A big thank you goes to all of my coauthors.
I have learned a lot from our collaboration and enjoyed working with you.
I also want to thank the colleagues at ALCom-Lab.
The time when we were together in the lab was a lifetime memory and supported me at some difficult moments during my study.
Furthermore, I want to thank the colleagues at IBM, the ERATO MMSD project, and SoSy-Lab,
for helping me adapt to a new environment and enjoy the research and life abroad.

Finally, I want to thank my parents for their endless love and support.
I also want to say sorry to them because I might not always be together with them when they need me.
