Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability was first proposed by Papadimitriou in 1985~\cite{Papadimitriou1985}.
It is described as games against nature.
It has many applications in artificial intelligence including probabilistic reasoning~\cite{Majercik2003}.
It is PSPACE-complete~\cite{Stockmeyer1973}.
A nice tutorial of SSAT is written by Majercik~\cite{SATHandbook-SSAT}.
Our papers~\cite{LeeIJCAI17RESSAT,LeeIJCAI18ERSSAT} are awesome.
