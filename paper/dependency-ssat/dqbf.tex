\section{Dependency quantified Boolean formula}
\label{sect:dqbf}

In contrast to the \textit{linearly ordered} prefix used in QBF, i.e., an existentially quantified variable will depend on all of its preceding universally quantified variables,
the quantification structure in DQBF is extended with Henkin quantifiers,
where the dependency of an existentially quantified variable on the universally quantified variables can be explicitly specified.

A DQBF $\Phi$ over a set $V=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m\}$ of variables is of the form:
\begin{align}
    \forall x_1, \ldots, \forall x_n, \exists y_1(D_{y_1}), \ldots, \exists y_m(D_{y_m}). \phi,
\end{align}
where each $D_{y_j}\subseteq \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ denotes the set of variables that variable $y_j$ can depend on,
and Boolean formula $\phi$ over $V$ is quantifier-free.
We denote the set $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ (resp. $\{y_1,\ldots,y_m\}$) of universally (resp. existentially) quantified variables of $\Phi$ by $V_{\Phi}^\forall$ (resp. $V_{\Phi}^\exists$).

Given a DQBF $\Phi$, it is satisfied if for each variable $y_j$, there exists a function $f_j:\mathcal{A}(D_{y_j})\rightarrow \mathbb{B}$, such that after substituting variables in $V_{\Phi}^\exists$ with their corresponding functions respectively, matrix $\phi$ yields a tautology over $V_{\Phi}^\forall$.
The set of functions $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_m\}$ is called a set of \textit{Skolem} functions for $\Phi$.
In other words, $\Phi$ is satisfied by $\mathcal{F}$ if
\begin{align}\label{eq:dqbf-min}
    \min_{\beta \in \mathcal{A}(V_{\Phi}^{\forall})}\mathds{1}_{\phi|_{\mathcal{F}}}(\beta)=1,
\end{align}
where $\mathds{1}_{\phi|_{\mathcal{F}}}(\cdot)$ is an indicator function to indicate whether an assignment over $V_{\Phi}^{\forall}$ belongs to the set of satisfying assignments of matrix $\phi$,
when variables in $V_{\Phi}^{\exists}$ are substituted by their Skolem functions in $\mathcal{F}$.
That is, $\phi|_{\mathcal{F}} = \{\beta\ |\ \phi(\beta(x_1), \ldots, \beta(x_n)$, $f_1|_{\beta}$, $\ldots, f_m|_{\beta})\equiv \top\}$,
where $f_j|_{\beta}$ is the logical value derived by substituting every $x_i\in D_{y_j}$ with $\beta(x_i)$ in function $f_j$.
The satisfiability problem of DQBF was shown to be NEXPTIME-complete~\cite{Peterson2001}.
