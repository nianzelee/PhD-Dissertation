\chapter{Exist-Random Quantified SSAT}
\label{chap:exist-random-ssat}

In this chapter, we propose a new algorithm motivated by a recent QBF-solving technique for exist-random quantified SSAT formulas, which are also known as \textit{E-MAJSAT}~\cite{Littman1998}.
Most content in this chapter is based on the conference paper~\cite{LeeIJCAI18ERSSAT} published at IJCAI '18.
