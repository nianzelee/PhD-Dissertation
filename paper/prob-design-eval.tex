\chapter{Probabilistic Design Evaluation}
\label{chap:prob-design-eval}

In this chapter, we propose a general formulation for the evaluation and verification of probabilistic design.
We establish the connection between the proposed formulation and SSAT, weighted model counting, and probabilistic model checking.
Moreover, a new SSAT algorithm based on \textit{binary decision diagram} (BDD) is proposed.
Most content in this chapter is based on our journal paper~\cite{LeeTC18ProbDesign} published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.
