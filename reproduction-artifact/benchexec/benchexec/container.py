    # We need to use the syscall clone(), which is similar to fork(), but not available
    # in the Python API. We can call it directly using ctypes, but then the state of the
    # Python interpreter is inconsistent, so we need to fix that. Python >= 3.7 has
    # three C functions that should be called before and after fork/clone:
    # https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sys.html#c.PyOS_BeforeFork
    # This is the same that os.fork() does (cf. os_fork_impl
    # in https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/posixmodule.c).
    # Furthermore, it is very important that we have the GIL during clone(),
    # otherwise the child will often deadlock when trying to execute Python code.
    # Luckily, the ctypes module allows us to hold the GIL while executing the
    # function by using ctypes.PyDLL as library access instead of ctypes.CLL.

    # Two difficulties remain:
    # 1. On Python < 3.7, only PyOS_AfterFork() (to be called in the child) exists.
    # Other cleanup done by os_fork_impl is not accessible to us, so we ignore it.
    # For example, we do not take the import lock because it is only
    # available via an internal API, and because the child should never import anything
    # anyway (inside the container, modules might not be visible).

    # 2. On all Python versions, the interpreter state in the child is inconsistent
    # until PyOS_AfterFork_Child() is called. However, if we pass the Python function
    # _python_clone_child_callback() as callback to clone and do the cleanup in
    # its first line, it is too late because the Python interpreter is already used.
    # This actually causes problems if benchexec is executed with a high number of
    # parallel runs because of thread contention, the gil_drop_request and a deadlock
    # in drop_gil (cf. https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/issues/435).
    # So we should avoid executing Python code at all before PyOS_AfterFork_Child().
    # We do not want to take the hassle of shipping C code with BenchExec, so we use
    # _generate_native_clone_child_callback() to generate machine code on the fly
    # as replacement for _python_clone_child_callback(). This works for x86_64 Linux
    # and we expect practically all BenchExec users to fall in this category. For others
    # there is still the pure Python callback, which in practice works totally fine as
    # long as there does not exist a huge number of threads.
    # There is a workaround using sys.setswitchinterval(), however, it is too late to
    # apply it here in this function, because gil_drop_request could already be set.
    # Summary:
    # - For Linux x86_64 we use native code from _generate_native_clone_child_callback()
    # - Otherwise, we use sys.setswitchinterval() as workaround in localexecution.py.
