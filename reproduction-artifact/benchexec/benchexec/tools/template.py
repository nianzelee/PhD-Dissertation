This module provides base classes from which tool-info modules need to inherit.
New tool-info modules should inherit from the latest class (BaseTool2),
other base classes are provided for compatibility with older tool-info modules.
The class that a tool-info module provides always has to have the name "Tool".

    """
    This class serves both as a template for tool-info implementations,
    and as an abstract super class for them.
    For writing a new tool info, inherit from this class and override
    the necessary methods (always executable() and name(),
    usually determine_result(), cmdline(), and version(),
    and maybe working_directory() and get_value_from_output(), too).

    BenchExec will then instantiate the tool-info module's class
    and call the methods that return general information about the tool first.
    In this phase, executable() will always be called, other methods may be called.
    Afterwards, the run-specific methods will be called,
    and for each run, cmdline() will always be called before determine_result().
    Apart from this, no guarantee is made about which methods are called
    and in which order. In particular, the class must not assume that determine_result()
    will be called for a run result immediately after cmdline() was called for that run.
    It is guaranteed, however, that one instance of the class will only be used for
    one instance of the tool (in one location), so for example executable() can store
    some information about the tool (e.g., its version) in an attribute
    and other methods can safely rely on this.

    In special circumstances, it can make sense to not inherit from this class.
    In such cases the tool-info module's class needs to implement all the methods
    defined here and BaseTool2.register needs to be called with the respective class
    (cf. documentation of abc.ABCMeta.register) to declare compatibility with BaseTool2.
    Note that we might add optional methods (with default implementations) to BaseTool2
    at any time.

    This class is supported since BenchExec 3.3.
    For older tool-info modules that still inherit from BaseTool we provide a
    [migration guide](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/tool-integration.md#migrating-tool-info-modules-to-new-api).

        OPTIONAL, this method is only necessary for tools
        that needs special environment variable, such as a modified PATH.
        However, for usability of the tool it is in general not recommended to require
        additional variables (tool uses outside of BenchExec would need to have them specified
        manually), but instead change the tool such that it does not need additional variables.
        For example, instead of requiring the tool directory to be added to PATH,
        the tool can be changed to call binaries from its own directory directly.
        This also has the benefit of not confusing bundled binaries
        with existing binaries of the system.

        Note that when executing benchmarks under a separate user account (with flag --user),
        the environment of the tool is a fresh almost-empty one.
        This function can be used to set some variables.

        Note that runexec usually overrides the environment variable $HOME and sets it to a fresh
        directory. If your tool relies on $HOME pointing to the real home directory,
        you can use the result of this function to overwrite the value specified by runexec.
        This is not recommended, however, because it means that runs may be influenced
        by files in the home directory, which hinders reproducibility.

        This method returns a dict that contains several further dicts.
        All keys and values have to be strings.
        Currently we support 3 identifiers in the outer dict:

        "keepEnv": If specified, the run gets initialized with a fresh environment and only
                  variables listed in this dict are copied from the system environment
                  (the values in this dict are ignored).
        "newEnv": Before the execution, the values are assigned to the real environment-identifiers.
                  This will override existing values.
        "additionalEnv": Before the execution, the values are appended to the real environment-identifiers.
                  The seperator for the appending must be given in this method,
                  so that the operation "realValue + additionalValue" is a valid value.
                  For example in the PATH-variable the additionalValue starts with a ":".

        OPTIONAL, this method is only necessary for tools

        However, for usability of the tool it is in general not recommended to require
        additional variables (tool uses outside of BenchExec would need to have them specified
        manually), but instead change the tool such that it does not need additional variables.
        For example, instead of requiring the tool directory to be added to PATH,
        the tool can be changed to call binaries from its own directory directly.
        This also has the benefit of not confusing bundled binaries
        with existing binaries of the system.

        Note that when executing benchmarks under a separate user account (with flag --user),
        the environment of the tool is a fresh almost-empty one.
        This function can be used to set some variables.

        Note that runexec usually overrides the environment variable $HOME and sets it to a fresh
        directory. If your tool relies on $HOME pointing to the real home directory,
        you can use the result of this function to overwrite the value specified by runexec.
        This is not recommended, however, because it means that runs may be influenced
        by files in the home directory, which hinders reproducibility.

        This method returns a dict that contains several further dicts.
        All keys and values have to be strings.

                  variables listed in this dict are copied from the system environment
                  (the values in this dict are ignored).
        "newEnv": Before the execution, the values are assigned to the real environment-identifiers.
                  This will override existing values.
        "additionalEnv": Before the execution, the values are appended to the real environment-identifiers.
                  The seperator for the appending must be given in this method,
                  so that the operation "realValue + additionalValue" is a valid value.
                  For example in the PATH-variable the additionalValue starts with a ":".
