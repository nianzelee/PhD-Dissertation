  <!-- <column> defines which column should appear in the tables (can appear multiple times).
       If omitted, all columns are used. The following features (which can also be combined) are available. -->
  <!-- Pre-defined columns of BenchExec can be used: -->
  <column title="*name of a column produced by BenchExec: status, category, score, cputime, walltime, memory*"/>
  <!-- Columns can be renamed: -->
  <column title="*name of a column produced by BenchExec*" displayTitle="new name"/>
  <!-- Data can be extracted using a pattern from the output of the tool
       (needs specific support in the tool-specific Python module): -->
  <column title="*name of a (new) column*">*pattern for extracting data from tool output*</column>
  <!-- Rounding can be specified: -->
  <column title="..." numberOfDigits="*optional number of significant digits for presenting the value*">...</column>
  <!-- If input value has no unit, unit for output and conversion factor can be specified: -->
  <column title="..." displayUnit="*unit*" scaleFactor="*number*">...</column>
  <!-- If input value has a unit, source unit must be specified for conversion to another unit: -->
  <column title="..." sourceUnit="*source unit*" displayUnit="*unit*" scaleFactor="*number*">...</column>
  <!-- Table cells can contain configurable link: -->
  <column title="..." href="*path relative to this file or absolute URL*">*(optional) text to appear in all cells of the column*</column>
  <!-- Using a different column to calculate the differences table is also
       possible. If this is used, only the columns with this attribute will be
       considered for the differences table. -->
  <column title="..." relevantForDiff="true">...</column>

  <!-- <result> defines from which files to take the benchmark results (can appear multiple times).
       If <result> is not used, the files need to be passed as command-line arguments to table-generator. -->

         and all these results should be placed below each other in the table
         (note that you will not be able to distinguish them),
         add a unique attribute "id" to the <result> tag
         and make sure its file pattern matches only one file. -->
